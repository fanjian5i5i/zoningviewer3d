The proposed project is comprised of up to approximately 1.26 million square feet of mixed-use redevelopment, consisting of a new office building with ground floor retail, two new residential buildings, a one- to two-story vertical retail expansion of the existing Back Bay Station building, and the partial redevelopment of the existing 165 Dartmouth Street Garage.\n\nFor more information about the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) that is reviewing this project, please visit: http://bit.ly/BBSEGP",
